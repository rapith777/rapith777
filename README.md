# Hi, I'm Rajesh 👋  
### Software Engineer | Backend & Systems Integration

I design and build reliable backend systems that integrate **real-world hardware, automation platforms, and services** into clean, maintainable APIs.  
My work focuses on **backend engineering, system integration, and industrial/robotic automation**, with an emphasis on robustness, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, C  
- **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, REST, JSON-RPC, ASGI (Uvicorn), Pydantic  
- **Automation & Communication:** OPC UA, TCP/IP, CAN-Bus, ROS  
- **Systems & Infrastructure:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, Linux, distributed and asynchronous workflows  
- **Data & Applied AI:** Structured data processing, API-driven LLM backends (local LLMs, JSON-constrained outputs)

---

## 📌 What I Work On

- Backend services for **robotics, lab automation, and industrial systems**  
- Integration of **hardware, sensors, controllers, and backend APIs**  
- Clean API design with **strong validation and predictable data contracts**  
- Modular, testable architectures for **long-running and asynchronous systems**  
- Applying modern tools (including LLM-backed services) **where they add practical value**
